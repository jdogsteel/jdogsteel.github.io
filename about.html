																		to achieve this goal I make a conscious effort to keep my design centered
																		around the player and their emotions, goals, and desires. If a game is 
																		centered around the player from the beginning of development, then the game		
																		is more likely to resonate with its users. Having the systems understanding
																		I do allows me to create logical systems, storyarchs, and reusable code. I am
																		passionate about the experience that the player will have, but more importantly
																		I am passionate about how to achieve thos experiences.</p></div></td>
